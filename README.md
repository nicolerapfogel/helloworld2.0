This new version digs more deeply into what drives individuals to support the causes they do and the interplay of activism and identity. Upon first glance, not much has changed, except people now carry signs instead of flags on flag poles. Each person is a (somewhat stereotyped) image of a person you'd expect to be personally affected by each image. However, when you click, the signs shuffle so that each person is holding a sign of an issue that no longer directly affects them, but rather requires some empathy and concern for others to support. A new quote by Lilla Watsom replaces "Roe Roe Roe Your Vote." I chose this quote because it is a popular one in progressive activist spaces and really gets at the idea that no one is totally free if their peers or neighbors remain unfree. Liberation for all of us requires a coalition effort and concern for the people around us. Even when our own chains feel heavy, we all have work to do to help others become freer.
